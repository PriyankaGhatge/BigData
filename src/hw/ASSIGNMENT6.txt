ASSIGNMENT 6


Q] What is an ArrayList ?
→ Arraylist is a class which implements List interface. On one hand, it behaves like a normal array,
providing all the benefits of it and, on the other,it is a generic re-sizable collection implementation 
of the List interface. Java ArrayList is especially used for managing a large number of objects. 


Q] What is an Iterator?
→  Iterator is a class that has cursor properties.Sothe object of this class acts as a cursor and traverses 
through a collection accessing each data from it either for obtaining or for deletion of data . 
For e.g.-You can add or delete a first and last element from an ArrayList.


Q] What are characteristics of ArrayList?
→ 1. Java ArrayList uses an array as the internal programming construct to store elements.
2.It implements all optional list operations and it also permits all elements, includes null.
3.It provides methods to manipulate the size of the array that is used internally to store the list.
4.Java ArrayList class can contain duplicate elements.
5.Java ArrayList class maintains insertion order.
6.Java ArrayList class is non synchronized.
7.Java ArrayList allows random access because array works at the index basis.
8.In Java ArrayList class, manipulation is slow because a lot of shifting needs to be occurred if any 
element is removed from the array list.


Q]what are advantages of ArrayList?
→  1.ArrayList can dynamically grow and shrink as per the need.
2.ArrayList class enables us to use predefined methods of it which makes our task easy.
3.Elements can be inserted at or deleted from a particular position.
4.ArrayList class has many methods to manipulate the stored objects( add(), remove()… ).
5.You can traverse an ArrayList in both the directions – forward and backward using ListIterator.
hasNext(),hasPrevious().


Q]Application of Arraylist in real life software.
→ You use arrayLists  all of the time in programming. Whenever you need to keep track of an ordered list of items, you'll use an array: a list of songs, a list of each keystroke a user clicks. Even in the JSON data format, you'll often use an arraylist to hold a list of objects.


Q] What is a Linked List ?
→ A linked list is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object.Each element 
(we will call it a node) of a list is comprising of two items - the data and a reference to the next node. 
The last node has a reference to null. The entry point into a linked list is called the head of the list.
It should be noted that head is not a separate node, but the reference to the first node. If the list is 
empty then the head is a null reference.
A linked list is a dynamic data structure. The number of nodes in a list is not fixed and can grow and shrink
on demand. Any application which has to deal with an unknown number of objects will need to use a linked list.




Q] What are characteristics of LinkedList?
→ 1.Java LinkedList class can contain duplicate elements.
2.Java LinkedList class maintains insertion order.
3.Java LinkedList class is non synchronized.
4.In Java LinkedList class, manipulation is fast because no shifting needs to be occurred.
5.Java LinkedList class can be used as list, stack or queue.


Q]What are advantages of LinkedList?
→ 1.Insertion and deletion node operations are easily implemented in a linked list.
2.Dynamic data structures such as stacks and queues can be implemented using a linked list
3.Backtracking is possible in two way linked list
4.There is no need to define an initial size for a linked list.


Q]Application of Arraylist in real life software.
→ 1. To implement back functionality in the internet browser. 
2.To store the possible moves in a chess game.
3. You have to store social network “feeds”. You do not know the size, and things may need to be dynamically added. 


Q]What is the difference between Arraylist and LinkedList ??
→ 
ArrayList 
	LinkedList
	Maintains indexes and element data
	Maintains element data and two pointers for neighbor nodes
	Memory consumption is relatively less
	Memory consumption is high in LinkedList comparatively
	In ArrayList all the elements need to be shifted to fill out the space created by removed element.
	Removal only requires change in the pointer location in the two neighbor nodes (elements) of the node which is going to be removed. 
	ArrayList maintains index based system for its elements as it uses array data structure 
	LinkedList implements doubly linked list which requires the traversal through all the elements for searching an element.
